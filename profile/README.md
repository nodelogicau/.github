# Our Mission

We believe there is huge potential for efficiency and productivity gains in connecting disparate software systems.

In large organizations we often see a patchwork of many thousands of applications and tools with limited interoperability.
This can result in process inefficiences and greater cognitive load on individuals responsibile for correlating
and merging data across systems.

Bespoke integrations are often developed at great cost to implement and maintain. Building a common platform for data
interoperability can be achieved organically through established standards and protocols.

Open standards and data formats offer the best foundation for such platforms, given the widespread support and
universal adoption by vendors.
