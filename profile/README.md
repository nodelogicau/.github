# Our Mission

We believe there is huge potential for efficiency and productivity gains in connecting disparate software systems.

In large organizations we often see a patchwork of many thousands of applications and tools with limited interoperability.
This can often result in process inefficiences and greater cognitive load on individuals responsibile for correlating
and merging data across systems.

Building a common platform for data interopability has long been a vision for many enterprise architects, but we think
it can be achieved organically through the identification and compliance with standards and established protocols.
